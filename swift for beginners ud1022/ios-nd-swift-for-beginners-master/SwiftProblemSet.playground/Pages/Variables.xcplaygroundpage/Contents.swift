//: ## Variables 
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
 ### Exercise 1
 
 For each of the following names and types, create a variable or constant that best represents it:
 
 - gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
 - ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
 - studentNickname (String)
 - teaspoonsNutmeg (Float)
 */
var gallonsRemainingInTank: Double
let ageOfSpecimenInWeeks: Int
let studentNickname: String
let teaspoonsNutmeg: Float
//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
var gallonsRemainingInTank2: Int = 2
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks2: Double = 32.45
let teaspoonsCinnamon: Int = 2
//: ### Exercise 3
//: Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared the entities stringToReverse and arrayOfCharacters as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with let, no variables. Note: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.
let stringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
let arrayOfCharacters = stringToReverse.reversed()
let newStringToReverse = String(arrayOfCharacters)
/*: 
### Exercise 4

 For the following descriptions, create a variable or constant that best represents it:

- an Int value representing the hunger level of an animal over time.
- an Int value representing the score always required to win a game.
- a String value representing a studentâ€™s birthday.
- a String value representing what a user types into the status update area.
*/
var animalHungerLevel: Int
let scoreRequiredToWin: Int
let studentBirthday: String
var userInput: String
