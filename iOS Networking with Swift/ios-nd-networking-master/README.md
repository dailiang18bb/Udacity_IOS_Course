# iOS Networking

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Networking with Swift course.

## Overview

iOS Networking teaches foundational principles of networking and how they are applied in an iOS-context. The course uses a series of example applications as demonstrations:

- ImageRequest
- SleepingInTheLibrary
- FlickFinder
- MyFavoriteMovies
- TheMovieManager

Each application has a corresponding "complete" version which is already fully-implemented. Also, TheMovieManger has two versions: one with and without a seperate "API client".

## Setup

Generally speaking, most projects can run without any additional setup. However, consult the iOS Networking with Swift course for more information.
